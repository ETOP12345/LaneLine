# Western Zone Dashboard

Public dashboard for Team Pacific Northwest Western Zone ranking views across supported age groups and genders.

Hosted at: https://ETOP12345.github.io/western-zone-dashboard/

This GitHub repository is the source of truth for the hosted site.

The public page is generated from official USA Swimming data:

1. `scripts/refresh-from-usa-event-rank.mjs` refreshes `data/swimmers.json` from the current Top Times API used by data.usaswimming.org for all configured age groups and genders.
2. `scripts/build-public-lite.mjs` rebuilds `index.html`.
3. `scripts/validate-age-groups.mjs` must pass before publishing. It checks every published swimmer against the current `data/swimmers.json` source record and fails if the published age, age group, gender, latest-team assignment, or duplicate swimmer identity is wrong.
4. `.github/workflows/daily-refresh.yml` runs the refresh daily, validates the age groups, and commits changes back to GitHub.
5. `.github/workflows/validate-dashboard.yml` also runs the same validation on every push and pull request so manual publishes get checked too.

The old USA Swimming Sisense/DataHub Event Rank route now redirects to the new Top Times app. If the daily refresh stops updating again, first verify that `scripts/refresh-from-usa-event-rank.mjs` still receives non-empty rows from `https://times-api.usaswimming.org/swims/TimesSearch/GetTopTimesLeaderBoard`.

The dashboard defaults to 11-12 Male and shows the top 50 swimmers. Age group and gender are the master filters: the ranking table, swimmer selector, team distribution, team drilldown, event drilldown, and AAA/tie drilldown must all be derived from the selected age group/gender top 50 only. A prominent disclaimer makes clear that the scoring is unofficial and may contain mistakes or wrong interpretations. The right-side details are generic and update based on the selected view or clicked row; no swimmer is hardcoded as a featured athlete.

Before any manual publish, always run:

```sh
node scripts/build-public-lite.mjs
node scripts/validate-age-groups.mjs
```

Do not publish `index.html` if validation fails. A stale page can look internally consistent, for example by showing a swimmer as age 12 in `11-12`, while the refreshed source record says that swimmer now belongs in `13-14`.

For duplicate-looking swimmer names, do not merge by name alone. USA Swimming public ranking payloads used here do not expose birthdays, so duplicate records should only be merged when they share a USA Swimming/member/swim identity token or repeated identical swim-history evidence.

Before publishing UI changes, also spot-check the generated page data for at least one known regression case: Drake Kraft must not appear in the `11-12|M` published group if his current inferred age belongs in `13-14`.
